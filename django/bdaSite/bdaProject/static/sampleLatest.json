I probably did the same thing all of you did - I started the video and downloaded Love2d, installed it with the video on pause, then came here and clicked download.  Then I had issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, after longer than I would care to admit (couple of hours) I read through the Assignment0 and it says to use Love2D build 0.10.2 and provides a link to download older versions of the software.  I did this, and now everything works exactly as the class intends, with no issues.  \r\n\r\nI don't know if it will upgrade to the newer versions of Love2d as the class progresses or not, but if I can save anyone else the hassle, I hope this helps.",

Relevant methods now require floats between 0 and 1, and that's addressed in 2a4ab88 for `graphics.clear`. Note that the call to `graphics.setColor` should also be modified in the same way, but since Love seems to clip overflowing values to 1, the specific calls used here work as expected (if anyone tries a different color, though, they will likely hit the bug).\r\n\r\nThe other commit makes sure all versions of the game use a love11-aware version of Push (older versions make the game crash).
