Relevant methods now require floats between 0 and 1, and that's addressed in 2a4ab88 for `graphics.clear`. Note that the call to `graphics.setColor` should also be modified in the same way, but since Love seems to clip overflowing values to 1, the specific calls used here work as expected (if anyone tries a different color, though, they will likely hit the bug).\r\n\r\nThe other commit makes sure all versions of the game use a love11-aware version of Push (older versions make the game crash).
